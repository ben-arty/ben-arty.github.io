   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```

Then, start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```

Or with yarn:

```bash

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project to store environment variables. This file should not be committed to version control. Hereâ€™s an example:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn
```

### ESLint Configuration

You can customize ESLint rules in the `.eslintrc.js` file. Make sure to follow best practices to maintain code quality.

### Prettier Configuration

Adjust Prettier settings in the `.prettierrc` file to fit your coding style preferences.

---

## Testing

### Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```

This will execute all tests defined in your project. You can also run tests in watch mode with:

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```

Or:

```bash
yarn test --watch
```

### Writing Tests

Tests are located in the `__tests__` directory. Follow the structure to add your own tests. Make sure to cover your components and pages.

---

## CI/CD Integration

Integrate your project with CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions or Travis CI to automate testing and deployment. Hereâ€™s a basic example for GitHub Actions:

1. Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.

2. Add the following content:

   ```yaml
   name: CI

   on:
     push:
       branches:
         - main
     pull_request:
       branches:
         - main

   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2

       - name: Set up Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v2
         with:
           node-version: '14'

       - name: Install dependencies
         run: npm install

       - name: Run tests
         run: npm test
   ```
